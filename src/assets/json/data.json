The aim of this type of stress test is to assess the sensitivity to various risk scenarios. \nStress Tolerance Limits prescribed to monitor results of Stress Testing:\nThe Stress tests that Bank would undertake are classified broadly under three categories with increasing sensitivity viz Mild, Moderate & Severe Stress Tests. Since each category determines increasing intensity of Risk, the bank is having different Risk appetite for each category.
